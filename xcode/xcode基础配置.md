  Product Name:项目名称；

  Organization Name：

> The *organization name* is an **attribute of the Xcode project** and is used in boilerplate text throughout your project folder. For example, the organization name is used in the source and header file copyright strings. The organization name in your Xcode project isn’t the same as the organization name that you enter later in iTunes Connect.



 bundle ID 

>  The product name and *organization identifier* you enter are concatenated to create the default bundle ID using reverse domain name service (reverse DNS) notation. The *bundle ID* needs to be unique to your app, so it’s important to set the organization identifier to a unique string as well.



product NAME

- **Product Name:** The product name will be the name of your application. I have named my application Colorific, but feel free to name your application whatever you'd like.



Company Identifier:

>  Apple recommends adopting the reverse-domain naming convention in an attempt to make this unique.  **Note that the domain that you use has no tie to the DNS system or Internet domain names**
