#### Base

##### contentSize

The `contentSize` property is the size of the content that you need to display in the scroll view. In Creating Scroll Views in Interface Builder, it is set to 320 wide by 758 pixels high. The image in Figure 1-2 shows the content of the scroll view with the `contentSize` width and height indicated.

##### contentInset

额外的展示区域，使得contentsize 变大

>  One way of thinking of it is that it makes the scroll view content area larger
