> *All Heap Allocations* 是程序真实的内存分配情况，*All Anonymous VM*则是系统为程序分配的虚拟内存，为的就是当程序有需要的时候，能够及时为程序提供足够的内存空间，**

> Remember the second sentence in the previous paragraph. The operating system determines the size of the virtual memory block, not your app. That’s why you should focus on the heap allocations instead of anonymous VM. **Your app has no control over the size of the anonymous VM.**



| Persistent Bytes | The number of bytes that have been allocated, but not released, during the selected time range. |

| # Persistent     | The number of allocations that have been allocated, but not released, during the selected time range. |
| Transient Bytes  | The number of bytes that have been created and destroyed during the selected time range. |
| # Transient      | The number of allocations that have been created and destroyed during the selected time range. |
| Total Bytes      | The total number of bytes that have existed during the selected time range. |

#### CoreAnimation

- Color Blended Layers"正是用于检测哪里发生了图层混合，并用红色标记出来。因此我们需要尽可能减少看到的红色区域。一旦发现应该想法设法消除它

  > Shows blended view layers. Multiple view layers that are drawn on top of each other with blending enabled are highlighted in red. Reducing the amount of red in your app when this option is selected can dramatically improve your app’s performance. Blended view layers often cause slow table scrolling.
