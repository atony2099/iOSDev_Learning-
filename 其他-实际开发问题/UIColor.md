#### clear color

> A color object whose grayscale and alpha values are both 0.0.

Therefore the documentation is saying that `clearColor` is the color black with a completely transparent opacity. (which makes what color it is immaterial)

Basically whatever color/image is behind it will shine through with 100% clarity.
