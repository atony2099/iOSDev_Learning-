> A **particle system** is a technique in [game physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_physics), [motion graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_graphics), and [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics) that uses a large number of very small [sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)), [3D models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_model), or other graphic objects to simulate certain kinds of "fuzzy" phenomena, which are otherwise very hard to reproduce with conventional rendering techniques - usually highly [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) systems, natural phenomena, or processes caused by chemical reactions.
